# 🚀 Deploy in 5 Minutes - Quick Start

## Option 1: One-Click Deploy to Render (EASIEST)

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy on Render
1. Go to https://render.com
2. Sign up with GitHub (free)
3. Click "New +" → "Web Service"
4. Connect your GitHub repository
5. Render will auto-detect settings from `render.yaml`
6. Click "Create Web Service"
7. Wait 5-10 minutes
8. Done! Your app is live at `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`

**That's it!** The `render.yaml` file handles everything automatically.

## Option 2: Manual Render Setup

If auto-detection doesn't work:

### Build Command:
```bash
chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh
```

### Start Command:
```bash
gunicorn config.wsgi:application
```

### Environment Variables:
- `SECRET_KEY`: (auto-generated)
- `DEBUG`: `False`
- `PYTHON_VERSION`: `3.11.0`
- `DATABASE_URL`: (auto-provided by Render)

## Option 3: Railway.app (Alternative)

### Step 1: Push to GitHub (same as above)

### Step 2: Deploy on Railway
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository
5. Railway auto-detects Django
6. Add environment variables:
   - `SECRET_KEY`: Generate random string
   - `DEBUG`: `False`
7. Click "Deploy"
8. Done!

## 🎯 What Happens During Deployment?

The `build.sh` script automatically:
1. ✅ Installs Python dependencies
2. ✅ Installs Node.js dependencies
3. ✅ Builds React frontend
4. ✅ Collects Django static files
5. ✅ Runs database migrations

---

## 🔑 Important Notes

### Database
- **Render**: Automatically creates PostgreSQL database
- **Railway**: Automatically provisions PostgreSQL
- Your app switches from SQLite to PostgreSQL automatically

### Static Files
- Served by WhiteNoise (already configured)
- No separate CDN needed

### Environment Variables
- `SECRET_KEY`: Auto-generated by platform
- `DATABASE_URL`: Auto-provided by platform
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: Auto-configured from deployment URL

---

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### Check Build Logs
- Render: Dashboard → Your Service → "Logs" tab
- Railway: Project → "Deployments" → Click latest

### Common Issues

**Build fails at npm install**:
- Render/Railway should have Node.js pre-installed
- Check build logs for specific error

**Static files not loading**:
- Verify `collectstatic` ran in build logs
- Check `STATIC_ROOT` in settings.py

**Database errors**:
- Ensure `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set
- Check migrations ran successfully

**App won't start**:
- Verify `gunicorn` is in requirements.txt
- Check start command is correct

## 🎉 After Deployment

### Test Your App
1. Visit your deployment URL
2. Try calculating a trip:
   - Current: Los Angeles, CA
   - Pickup: Phoenix, AZ
   - Dropoff: Dallas, TX
3. Verify map loads
4. Check ELD logs display

### Monitor Your App
- **Render**: Dashboard shows CPU, memory, requests
- **Railway**: Metrics tab shows usage

### Keep It Awake (Render Free Tier)
Free tier sleeps after 15 min inactivity. Options:
1. Use UptimeRobot (free) to ping every 10 min
2. Upgrade to paid tier ($7/month) for always-on

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Custom Domain
1. Buy domain (Namecheap, Google Domains)
2. Add to Render/Railway dashboard
3. Update DNS records as shown
4. SSL certificate auto-generated

### Environment Variables
Store sensitive data as environment variables:
- API keys
- Secret keys
- Database credentials

### Monitoring
Set up alerts for:
- App downtime
- High error rates
- Slow response times
